# ECE 4180 A Light Alarm Clock
Please see the Wiki Tab for our complete documentation. 

Project Description:
This project is a sun rise alarm clock that slowly wakes the user up prior to a set alarm time using a RGB LED ring that mimics a sunrise. Research has shown that waking up to warm light leads to a more energized morning and easier wake up. The alarm clock also includes a Bluetooth color control wheel, custom sunrise and ssnooze duration, and a LED rainbow mode.
